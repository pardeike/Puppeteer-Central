			<p>
				These Terms of Service reflect the way Andreas Pardeike business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things we’ve always believed to be

				<h2>Service provider</h2>

				<p>We will use your Google/YouTube identity to allow others to communicate safely and with verified identities - nothing more.</p>

					<li>respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights</li>
